# skin.mousetuary
Mousetuary is a Kodi skin, derived from the Kodi default skin "Estuary" (at 1.9.11 on the krypton branch of phil65/skin.estuary)

The aim of Mousetuary is to make a skin that is a bit more mouse-friendly, for those who prefer to control a 10-foot HTPC interface with just a mouse.
Details of changes are in the TODO spreadsheet.
It also aims to take UI cues from Windows Media Center, especially in the live TV area. There is an optional keymap to allow WMC-like scrolling in the EPG, and guide sleection from live TV with ctrl-g. After installation, move wmc-keymap.xml and guidekey.py into the userdata/keymaps folder. (the rules for skins won't allow keymaps to be automatically installed)
