# skin.mousetuary
Mousetuary is a Kodi skin, derived from the Kodi default skin "Estuary" (at 1.9.11 on the krypton branch of phil65/skin.estuary)

The aim of Mousetuary is to make a skin that is a bit more mouse-friendly, for those who prefer to control a 10-foot HTPC interface with just a mouse.

It also aims to take UI cues from Windows Media Center, especially in the live TV area.
